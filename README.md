## Project Preview
The goal of this work is to locate a submarine in the Puget Sound using noisy acoustic
data over time using Fast Fourier Transform and Gaussian Filter. This work consists of three
sub-tasks in order to achieve the goal: 1) determine the frequency signature generated by the
submarine; 2) denoise the acoustic data to determine the path of the submarine; and 3) determine
the x, y coordinates of the submarine during the 24 hour period.
