# SubmarinePosition

## Project Preview
Your goal in this project is to locate a submarine in the Puget Sound using noisy acoustic data. We do not
know much about this submarine as it is a new technology that emits an unknown acoustic frequency that
you need to detect. Unfortunately the submarine is moving so its location and path need to be determined.
Broad spectrum recording of acoustics data obtained over 24 hours in half-hour increments is available
to you. 
The input data contain a matrix with 49 columns of data corresponding to the
measurements of acoustic pressure taken over 24 hours. The measurements themselves are 3D and taken on a
uniform grid of size 64 × 64 × 64.
